# Fridays

> Beer. So much more than just a breakfast drink!

Our team is quite social so we gather every Friday to conspire on all things .NET related. This may or may not include cooled fermented vegetable juice. It does, however, for sure involve Doritos.

The [member list](Members.md) takes care to help us decide who's next in line for pulling their weight.
